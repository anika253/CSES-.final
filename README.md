# 📘 CSES Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/).  
The goal is to build strong problem-solving skills in **Data Structures, Algorithms, and Competitive Programming**.  

---

## 📂 Topics Covered

This repository will include solutions from the following major categories:

- 🌳 **Trees**  
  Algorithms and problems involving tree data structures, LCA, binary lifting, subtree queries, etc.  

- 🌐 **Graphs**  
  Classic and advanced graph algorithms: BFS, DFS, shortest paths, spanning trees, SCCs, and more.  

- 📊 **Dynamic Programming (DP)**  
  Problems involving recursion + memoization, tabulation, knapsack variations, digit DP, etc.  

---

✨ More topics (like **Sorting & Searching, Range Queries, Strings, Mathematics**) will be added as I progress through the sheet.
